# Feature branch model

This repository uses the feature branch model.  All new features _should_ be
written in separate branches named "feature/{feature-name}" where feature-name
is the (descriptive) name of your new feature.

Subsequently, features are merged into the master branch by a pull request,
which must be approved by the maintainer of this repository before merging.

The maintainer is:
